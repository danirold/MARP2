# MARP2

Repository focused on advanced algorithmic techniques for complex problem solving. 
It covers Dynamic Programming, Branch and Bound, and state-space search, alongside probabilistic and approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. 

This collection includes solved problems from the MARPII (Algorithmic Methods for Problem Solving II) course, part of the Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).
